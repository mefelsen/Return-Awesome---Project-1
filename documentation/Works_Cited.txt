Work Cited

We did not use any other libraries or frameworks in our project.

Although we did not directly copy code from anywhere to complete our project, we owe https://www.w3schools.com/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/
a lot for helping us with javascript, css, and html. Essentially when in doubt, we went there. :)
